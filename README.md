* Project following the Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl

## Project Reflection:

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to get the app running locally on your machine.
```
$ bundle install --without production
```
Next, migrate the database:
```
$ rails db:migrate
```
Finally, run the test suite to double check things are functioning as intended:
```
$ rails test
```
Fire up that local server!
```
$ rails server
```
